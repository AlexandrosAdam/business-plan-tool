# Abstract
The competitive modern business environment requires organization and planning in every business decision. Planning is the key to successful investments no matter if we are talking about starting a new business or expanding a running company. The process of writing the plan itself is the best way to comprehend the important aspects of the business. This process though may seem complex and difficult especially for new entrepreneurs. An innovative or problem solving business idea does not necessarily come from an experienced executive. Therefore there is a market need for tools and applications that simplify this process and help anyone develop a reliable and structured business plan. Through an in depth online search we have found that such tools do exist but they are costly which make them less accessible especially for new under-financed businesses. The objective of this thesis is to suggest a computer tool for Business Plan development which operates as an open source software.
